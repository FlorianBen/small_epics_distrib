# Small Python script to generate an EPICS distribution

This repository contains small Python scripts for creating an EPICS distribution on linux.

It is definitely less capable than production packaging methods like containers and so on.
But it may be useful for deploying a small EPICS development environment on a personal laptop.

Features:
- [x] Download EPICS base and modules according to a configuration file.
- [x] Download module dependencies.
- [x] Create configuration files and Makefiles.
- [ ] Support custom versioning for each package.
- [ ] Support static build.
- [ ] Support folder installation.

## Requirements 

EPICS system dependencies must be installed on your Linux OS. As well as Python. 

## How to use

Edit the `cfg/config.toml` and add or remove modules needed. Then simply run the Python script `main.py`.
